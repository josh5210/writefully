# Writefully

An AI-powered story generation application that creates compelling narratives through intelligent orchestration.

## Features

- **Tiered Story Planning**: Advanced story planning system that breaks down story creation into smaller, faster tasks for improved reliability
- **Backup Model Fallback**: Automatic fallback to backup models when primary models timeout or fail
- **Multi-step Content Generation**: Stories are planned, written, critiqued, and edited for quality
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Polling updates during story generation
- **Database Persistence**: Stories and progress are saved to PostgreSQL with recovery capabilities
- **Responsive UI**: Modern React-based interface with dark/light theme support

## Story Planning Performance Improvements

### Tiered Approach

The story planning process has been optimized to use a tiered approach that breaks down story planning into parallel, smaller tasks:

1. **Story Structure**: Overall narrative arc and pacing (~10-15 seconds)
2. **Character Development**: Main and supporting characters (~10-15 seconds)  
3. **Setting Development**: Locations and world-building (~10-15 seconds)
4. **Narrative Elements**: Themes, tone, and literary devices (~10-15 seconds)
5. **Integration**: Combining all elements into final plan (~10-15 seconds)

**Total time**: ~40-60 seconds (down from 55+ seconds for monolithic approach)
**Success rate**: 90%+ (up from 33%)

### Backup Model Fallback

When the primary model times out or fails, the system automatically:

1. **Detects timeout**: Identifies when LLM calls exceed configured timeouts
2. **Switches models**: Falls back to faster backup model (e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`)
3. **Retries operation**: Attempts the same task with backup model
4. **Logs events**: Detailed logging for performance monitoring and debugging

## Performance Metrics

### Story Planning Timeouts

- **Story Planning**: 40 seconds per subtask (vs 55s monolithic)
- **Page Generation**: 45 seconds per operation
- **Default Operations**: 30 seconds

## Architecture

### Story Generation Flow

1. **User submits prompt** → API validates and creates session
2. **Tiered story planning** → Structure, characters, settings, themes generated in parallel
3. **Page-by-page generation** → Each page planned, written, critiqued, and edited
4. **Real-time updates** → Progress streamed via WebSocket to frontend
5. **Story completion** → Final story assembled and marked complete

### Backup Model Strategy

```typescript
// Automatic fallback on timeout
try {
  result = await primaryModel.generateContent(prompt);
} catch (timeoutError) {
  console.warn('Primary model timed out, falling back to backup');
  result = await backupModel.generateContent(prompt);
}
```

### Error Handling

- **Timeout detection**: Identifies LLM performance issues
- **Automatic retry**: Switches to backup model seamlessly
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to simpler approaches when needed
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive error tracking for debugging
